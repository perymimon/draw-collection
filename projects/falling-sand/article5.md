# Building a Falling Sand Simulation with JavaScript and Canvas (Part 1)

In this article, weâ€™ve built a **falling sand simulation** step by step, starting with a simple grid and gradually adding features like chunk-based operations, performance optimizations, and interactivity. Along the way, weâ€™ve explored the challenges of simulating particle behavior and learned how to make the simulation smooth and responsive.

In this final section, weâ€™ll add a **cool auto mouse press animation** to demonstrate the simulation in action and link to the full code and utilities on GitHub.

## Adding an Auto Mouse Press Animation

To make the simulation more engaging, letâ€™s add an **auto mouse press animation** using HTML and CSS. This will simulate user interaction by automatically clicking on the canvas in a predefined pattern.

### HTML and CSS
Add a `div` element for the fake mouse and style it with CSS animations:

```html
<div id="mouse"></div>
<style>
  #mouse {
    position: absolute;
    animation: moveAlongPath 4s linear infinite alternate,
               moveAlongPath2 30s linear infinite alternate;
    offset-path: path("M25,50 C50,10 75,10 75,50 C75,90 25,90 25,50 Z");
  }

  @keyframes moveAlongPath {
    0% { offset-distance: 0%; }
    100% { offset-distance: 100%; }
  }

  @keyframes moveAlongPath2 {
    0% { left: 2em; }
    100% { left: calc(100% - 5em); }
  }
</style>
```

### JavaScript
Update the `pointer.onPress` logic to include the auto mouse press animation:

```javascript
var hsl = 0;
pointer.onPress = (({x, y}) => {
  let {width, height} = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
  let ratioW = width / canvas.width;
  let ratioH = height / canvas.height;
  let cellX = Math.floor(x / (cellSize * ratioW));
  let cellY = Math.floor(y / (cellSize * ratioH));
  hsl = (hsl + 1) % 80;
  grid.setChunk2(30 + hsl, cellX, cellY, 0b101010101, 'pad');
});

// Start simulation
new FrameEngine(60, function () {
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, ctx.canvas.width, ctx.canvas.height);
  grid.draw(ctx, cellSize, {
    strokeStyle: 'black',
  });
  update();
}).start();

// Auto mouse press animation
var fakeMouse = document.getElementById('mouse');
var animationMouse = new FrameEngine(60, function () {
  var {x, y} = fakeMouse.getBoundingClientRect();
  pointer.onPress({x, y});
}).start();

// Stop animation on user tap
pointer.onTap = e => animationMouse.stop();
```

## Exploring the Code

All the utilities used in this project, including the `FrameEngine`, are available in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/perymimon/portofolio/tree/main/projects/_glossary). These tools were written from scratch and are designed to be modular and reusable. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of whatâ€™s included:

- **`FrameEngine`**: A utility for managing frame-based animations and updates.
- **`Pointer`**: A helper for handling mouse and touch input.
- **Math Utilities**: Functions like `randomItem` and `exceedsLimits` for common math operations.

Feel free to explore the repository and use these tools in your own projects!

## Whatâ€™s Next?

In **Part 2**, weâ€™ll dive deeper into the simulation by adding a new material called the **Matrix Material**. This material will introduce complex behaviors like:
- **Phasing through other materials**.
- **Dispersing and collapsing surrounding particles**.
- **Dynamic state transitions** based on interactions.

Weâ€™ll also explore how to extend the state machine to handle these new behaviors and make the simulation even more dynamic and interactive.

## Conclusion

In this article, weâ€™ve built a falling sand simulation from scratch, starting with a simple grid and gradually adding features like chunk-based operations, performance optimizations, and interactivity. Weâ€™ve also added a cool auto mouse press animation to demonstrate the simulation in action.

You can find the full code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/perymimon/portofolio/tree/main/projects) and try the working demo [here](https://perymimon.github.io/portofolio/projects/falling-sand).

Stay tuned for **Part 2**, where weâ€™ll add the Matrix Material and explore even more advanced simulation techniques. Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
